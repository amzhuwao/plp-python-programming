Objectives Of the Topic 🌟
Master Files: Get hands-on with opening, reading, writing, and closing files in Python!
Handle Errors Like a Pro: Learn how to catch and manage errors, ensuring your code runs smoothly even when things don’t go as planned.


What is File Handling? 📁

File Handling in Python is the ability to perform various operations on files, like reading from and writing to them. Files are used to store data permanently (like text documents, images, or spreadsheets). Unlike variables, which lose their values when a program ends, files provide persistent storage.

File handling in Python allows you to:

Open files in different modes (e.g., read-only or write mode).
Read and write data in a variety of formats.
Close files to free up system resources.

Python’s built-in open() function is at the heart of this process, and learning how to handle files can make your programs more robust, flexible, and useful.


Outcomes 🎉

By the end of this module, you’ll be skilled in managing files efficiently in Python, ensuring error-free code that gracefully handles unexpected issues. Mastering files and exception handling will allow you to build strong, robust applications!
